OpenShift Version Compatibility
------------
When listing this role in `requirements.yml`, make sure to pin the version of the role via one of the tags:

```
- src: openshift-labs.workshop_deployment_tracker
  version: 1.0.0
```  

The following tables shows the version combinations that are tested and verified:

| Role Version      | OpenShift Version |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1.0.x   | 3.11.x   |


Note that if a version combination is not listed above, it does **NOT** mean that the latest role version 
won't work on that OpensShift version. The above table is merely the combinations that we have tested and verified.
